# iTunes Search App

## Objectives

The objective of the current project is to search a name of an artist, by example "Jack+Johnson", and given that string show all the albums that were released by that artist.

## Installation

This project was developed using React and the iTunes Search API.
To use React, first we will have to download a Local Development Environment , it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code and download the latest version.(For macOS: vscode-darwin-universal.zip)

Later we will download Node.js version 18.13.0 LTS from their website https://nodejs.org/en/. Once we have downloaded it, we will type the following command on our Terminal " node -v " so we can be sure that Node.js was downloaded successfully.

Now we will have to create our React project using the following command on a file which we had created earlier " npx create-react-app my-app ", where my-app will be the name of our project.

Once it creates our React project we will have to download the styling solution which is Styled-Components typing the following command line: " npm install styled-components "

## How to Run

Having installed all the tools needed, to run the project we will type the following command line on our Terminal: " npm start ", and will be able to search all of the artist we like and see the price, name of that artist and the name of the albums released by a given artist.
